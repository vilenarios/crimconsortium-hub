## 📝 **Development Notes**

### **Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **Static over dynamic**: Chose pre-generated HTML for reliability and speed
2. **Local PDF storage**: Included 37 PDFs in archive for permanent access
3. **Inline styles**: Reduced external dependencies for Arweave optimization
4. **Complete dataset inclusion**: 56MB JSON file for future extensibility
5. **Self-contained architecture**: No external services or APIs required

### **Lessons Learned:**
1. **Academic teams prefer simple deployment** over complex systems
2. **Static sites provide reliable preservation** for academic content
3. **Local asset storage ensures permanence** on decentralized systems
4. **Complete documentation critical** for team handoff
5. **Build system reliability more important** than feature complexity

**This represents a complete, production-ready academic archive solution optimized for permanent preservation on Arweave.**
